* How to set up the 'maint' branch.

  Ensure that the following packages are installed in your system:

  - Autoconf, Automake, and GNU Make.

  - Git (1.6.x.x or later)

  - Python (2.6 or later)

    Python 2.6 is needed for textwrap.TextWrapper break_on_hypens option only.
    This is being worked on decrease python version requirements.

  Now run the following commands:

  : git clone ssh://git.sv.gnu.org/srv/git/autoconf-archive
  : cd autoconf-archive
  : git checkout -b maint origin/maint
  : git submodule update -i
  : cvs -z3 -d:ext:cvs.savannah.nongnu.org:/web/autoconf-archive co -d html autoconf-archive
  : ./bootstrap.sh
  : ./configure

* How to build the web site.

  Run "make website".

* How to build release tarballs.

  Run "make </dev/null alpha". Other possible release types are "beta" and
  "major". Unfortunately, one of the tests performed during that procedure
  doesn't terminate until it receives an EOF on standard input. I have no idea
  why, but redirecting from /dev/null remedies the problem.
