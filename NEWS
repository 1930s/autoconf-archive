* Noteworthy changes in release ?.? (????-??-??) [?]



* Noteworthy changes in release 2010.02.14 (2010-02-14) [beta]

  All macros have been assigned a unique serial number that corresponds to the
  number of commits that have modified the macro in the Archive's Git
  repository. Refer to the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool//manual/automake/Serials.html][Automake documentation on serial numbers]] for further
  details about why these numbers are useful.

  The text of the all-permissive license has been augmented by an express
  warranty disclaimer as [[http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/License-Notices-for-Other-Files.html][suggested by the Free Software Foundation]].

  AX_CXX_VERBOSE_TERMINATE_HANDLER has been generalized to support
  architectures other than GNU libstdc++.

  AX_CHECK_ICU has been extended to support icu-specific CPPFLAGS.

  AX_BOOST_BASE has been improved to work correctly in a cross-compilation
  environment and extended to support an
  ACTION-IF-FOUND/ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND-style API.

  AX_PTHREAD has been updated to succeed when compiling with -Wall and -Werror.

  AX_C_IFDEF has been deprecated, because the standard Autoconf macro
  AC_CHECK_DECL provides the same functionality.

  AX_C_PRINTF_THSEP has been deprecated because of technical flaws. See
  http://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6848 for further details.

  AX_RESTORE_FLAGS and AX_SAVE_FLAGS have been added.

  AX_SYS_LARGEFILE_SENSITIVE has improved support for x86_64 hosts.

  AX_MPIP has been added.

  In all macros, calls to the obsolete AC_HELP_STRING function have been
  replaced with the newer, recommended AS_HELP_STRING.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2009.12.16 (2009-12-16) [alpha]

  All macros that used a prefix other than AX_ -- or no prefix at all -- have
  been renamed to use AX_ consistently. The new version forward old calls under
  their old names to the new ones via Autoconf's AU_ALIAS mechanism.

  The HTML documentation is obsolete. Instead, the archive now ships its
  documentation in Texinfo format.

  All macros distributed by the archive are now licensed under terms that do
  *not* limit the choice of license for the generated configure script.
  Previous releases didn't meet this requirement because they contained macros
  that were licensed under GPL or Lesser GPL without an Autoconf Exception.

  Please refer to the [[ChangeLog]] file for a complete list of changes.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2009.07.31 (2009-07-31) [alpha]

  The archive has moved to Savannah: http://www.nongnu.org/autoconf-archive/
  Version 2009-04-26 was the last to be released at autoconf-archive.cryp.to.

  The version identifier has been changed to a "year.month.day" spelling,
  rather than the ISO format, because the dot-separated spelling works better
  for most distributions and for the gnulib infrastructure.

  The 2009.07.31 release was an internal test release that has never been
  publicly available.
