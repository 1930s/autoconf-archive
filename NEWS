* Noteworthy changes in release ?.? (????-??-??) [?]

  The macros AX_WITH_GUILE, AX_WITH_PERL, AX_WITH_PYTHON, and AX_WITH_RUBY are
  considered obsolete and will be deleted from the archive in the foreseeable
  future. Use of obsolete macros can be identified by running autoconf(1) with
  the flag -Wobsolete. Furthermore, the standard utility autoupdate(1) provides
  assistance with updating existing "configure.ac" files.

  AX_PROG_DOXYGEN has been extended to implement "DX_DOT_FEATURE(ON|OFF)". This
  feature was documented, but it didn't actually exist. Further details are
  available at <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7340>.

  A bug in AX_BOOST_BASE has been fixed that would cause BOOST_LDFLAGS to be
  detected incorrectly. See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7337> for further
  details.

  AX_LIB_HDF5 has been extended to support requesting either a serial or a
  parallel HDF5 installation. Furthermore, the macro can now detect whether or
  not a Fortran-ready installation is present. Further details are available at
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7338>.

  AX_CFLAGS_WARN_ALL has been cleaned up to avoid use of obsolete Autoconf
  constructs. Also, a new variant of the macro, AX_FCFLAGS_WARN_ALL, has been
  added to enable support for Fortran. Further details are available at
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7335>.

  AX_COMPILER_VENDOR has been extended to support the Clang compiler.

  Caching issues in AX_BLAS have been remedied. Further details are available
  at <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7320>.

  Plenty of Autoconf 2.68 warnings have been fixed.

  Added initial version of AX_CC_FOR_BUILD.

  AX_LUA_LIB_VERSION has been renamed to AX_LUA_HEADERS_VERSION, because that
  is what the macro is checking, really. A new macro AX_LUA_READLINE has been
  added.

  The AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H macro has been improved to support the system shell
  "dash". See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7317> for further details.

  The AX_BLAS_F77_FUNC macro has been improved to properly save and restore the
  value of the $LIBS variable. Furthermore, an extra check was added to verify
  that the integer size of Fortran (4 or 8 bytes) matches that of BLAS. See
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7311> for further details.

  AX_TLS has been updated to usual FOUND/NOT-FOUND interface.

  Handling of indirectly named shell variables has been fixed in
  AX_CFLAGS_GCC_OPTION. There have also been improvements to the
  documentation. See <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7291> and
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7292> for further details.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2010.08.19 (2010-08-19) [stable]

  64-bit support in the boost macros has been improved. Further details are at:
  <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-archive-maintainers/2010-08/msg00008.html>.

  A test logic error in AX_LIB_MYSQL has been fixed. Further details are at
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7285>.

  The boost macros for iostreams, regex, serialization, signals, system,
  test_exec_monitor, unit_test_framework, wave, and wserialization have been
  patched not to rely on being executed by a 'bash' shell. Also, an
  under-quoted shell variable has been fixed in AX_BOOST_BASE.

  The documentation of AX_MPI has been improved. Further details are at
  <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/autoconf-archive-maintainers/2010-08/msg00000.html>.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2010.07.06 (2010-07-06) [stable]

  Fixed compiler warning in AX_PTHREAD's test program for AC_TRY_LINK.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2010.06.04 (2010-06-04) [beta]

  The Autoconf Archive has been declared an official GNU project. Consequently,
  the web site has moved from <http://www.nongnu.org/autoconf-archive/> to
  <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/>. Old addresses remain valid
  for the foreseeable future, though.

  AX_BOOST_DATE_TIME and AX_BOOST_FILESYSTEM have been patched to function
  correctly on systems that use "dash" as the system shell (i.e. Debian).

  AX_PTHREAD has been fixed to provide the "-pthreads" flag on 10.6 OS X
  systems.

  Fixed use of $EXEEXT in AX_CHECK_JAVA_HOME, AX_PROG_JAVA, AX_PROG_JAVA_WORKS,
  AX_PROG_JAVAC, and AX_PROG_JAVADOC. Further details can be found at
  <http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?6948>.

  AX_LIB_LIBKML, a macro to detect Google's libkml library, has been added. See
  http://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?7109 for further details.

  AX_PREFIX_CONFIG_H has been bug-fixed to avoid generating extraneous spaces
  that would break prefixed macros.

  AX_F90_MODULE_FLAG has been bug-fixed with regard to the Compaq Alpha Fortran
  compiler.

  A typo in the code of AX_PYTHON_EMBED has been fixed that resulted in the
  function AX_PYTHON_INSIST being undefined.

  The new AX_LIB_HDF5 macro provides functionality to detect the HDF5 library.

  The version detection code in AX_PKG_SWIG has been fixed. Previous versions
  of this macro would fail to accept SWIG 2.0 where SWIG >= 1.3.x was requested.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2010.02.14 (2010-02-14) [beta]

  All macros have been assigned a unique serial number that corresponds to the
  number of commits that have modified the macro in the Archive's Git
  repository. Refer to the [[http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool//manual/automake/Serials.html][Automake documentation on serial numbers]] for further
  details about why these numbers are useful.

  The text of the all-permissive license has been augmented by an express
  warranty disclaimer as [[http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/License-Notices-for-Other-Files.html][suggested by the Free Software Foundation]].

  AX_CXX_VERBOSE_TERMINATE_HANDLER has been generalized to support
  architectures other than GNU libstdc++.

  AX_CHECK_ICU has been extended to support icu-specific CPPFLAGS.

  AX_BOOST_BASE has been improved to work correctly in a cross-compilation
  environment and extended to support an
  ACTION-IF-FOUND/ACTION-IF-NOT-FOUND-style API.

  AX_PTHREAD has been updated to succeed when compiling with -Wall and -Werror.

  AX_C_IFDEF has been deprecated, because the standard Autoconf macro
  AC_CHECK_DECL provides the same functionality.

  AX_C_PRINTF_THSEP has been deprecated because of technical flaws. See
  http://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?6848 for further details.

  AX_RESTORE_FLAGS and AX_SAVE_FLAGS have been added.

  AX_SYS_LARGEFILE_SENSITIVE has improved support for x86_64 hosts.

  AX_MPIP has been added.

  In all macros, calls to the obsolete AC_HELP_STRING function have been
  replaced with the newer, recommended AS_HELP_STRING.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2009.12.16 (2009-12-16) [alpha]

  All macros that used a prefix other than AX_ -- or no prefix at all -- have
  been renamed to use AX_ consistently. The new version forward old calls under
  their old names to the new ones via Autoconf's AU_ALIAS mechanism.

  The HTML documentation is obsolete. Instead, the archive now ships its
  documentation in Texinfo format.

  All macros distributed by the archive are now licensed under terms that do
  *not* limit the choice of license for the generated configure script.
  Previous releases didn't meet this requirement because they contained macros
  that were licensed under GPL or Lesser GPL without an Autoconf Exception.

  Please refer to the [[ChangeLog]] file for a complete list of changes.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2009.07.31 (2009-07-31) [alpha]

  The archive has moved to Savannah: http://www.nongnu.org/autoconf-archive/
  Version 2009-04-26 was the last to be released at autoconf-archive.cryp.to.

  The version identifier has been changed to a "year.month.day" spelling,
  rather than the ISO format, because the dot-separated spelling works better
  for most distributions and for the gnulib infrastructure.

  The 2009.07.31 release was an internal test release that has never been
  publicly available.
