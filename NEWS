                        History of the Autoconf Archive
                        ===============================

2009-04-26:

        Moved the entire project to Savannah: http://www.nongnu.org/autoconf-archive/

        Obsolete macros were deleted from the archive. The release tarballs
        will no longer contain them, but the download URLs will continue to
        work for the foreseeable future. For every deleted macros, there is
        also a stub HTML page the features an appropriate link into the Git
        repository.

        The last-modified-date section was removed from all m4 files. The
        information is redundant: the GIT repository contains that
        information (and much more). Originally, the idea behind that
        timestamp was that users should always be able to infer the macros
        "version", i.e. even from a generated configure script. In practice,
        however, that didn't work well. For one, those timestamps have a
        tendency to be plain wrong. Secondly, even if the timestamp was
        correct, it's presence still didn't tell you that the macro you're
        seeing is actually identical with the one in the Autoconf Archive.
        After 9 years of trouble with that bit, I conclude that keeping
        unique version information inside of the file that's supposed to be
        versioned just isn't a good idea.

        The "copyleft" section has been renamed to "license" for greater
        accuracy. Some licenses, like all-permissive, are not really
        copylefts.

        The cross-reference graphs have been removed from the HTML pages.
        These dot-graphs were useful a while ago, when the archive was
        comparatively small, but with the current number 500+ macros, those
        graphs tended to be far too large to be useful.

        Ensured that all files to refer to this project consistently as
        "Autoconf Archive".

        Fixed some charset issues in the generated HTML files. Now, all
        pages are written in plain ASCII, and special characters are encoded
        as HTML entities.

        Added an by-license index page.

2008-04-12:

        The markup format distributed by the Autoconf Archive has changed to
        accomodate the aclocal utility distributed with Automake. Further
        details are available in the GIT repository:

          http://git.cryp.to/autoconf-archive?a=commit;h=76c7d0ad8925ab22e3bb50c8b27b333f31303c74

2007-08-22:

        The macro documentation shipped in the release tarball now features
        cross-references.

2007-07-29:

        This release is the first one to be distributed under the terms of
        the updated General Public License, version 3.

2007-02-18:

        The Autoconf Archive provides a public GIT repository that can be
        cloned as follows:

          git clone http://git.cryp.to/autoconf-archive

        A web front-end is available under the same URL.

        As a new feature, the web front-end allows every macro to link
        directly into the repository for its own history.

2006-10-23:

        The Autoconf Archive switched to a new distribution format. Unlike
        the previous one, the new format has no visible markup and looks
        pretty much like formatted text. The m4 files now link to their home
        page. Also new is that the copyright licenses are spelled out.

2005-02-14:

        The Autoconf Archive repository has moved from gnu.org to
        <http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to/>, mostly because running on my own
        infrastructure is far more convenient than depending on Savannah.

        This release is the first one to have an out-of-the-box installation
        procedure using Autoconf/Automake.

2005-01-28:

        The Free Software Foundation recommends the all-permissive license
        for Autoconf Macros. In an heroic effort, Tom Howard has contacted
        each and every macro author in an attempt to get their permission to
        re-license their work under the less restrictive license. More than
        50 positive responses are received.

2005-01-21:

        Moved all macros into a flat hierarchy. Previous releases determined
        a macro's category by the name of the directory it was in. This
        convention no longer necessary. Having the files in a flat hierarchy
        works vastly better with the aclocal(1) utility than the previous
        layout.

        This release also marks the departure from free-style version
        numbers. All version information is expressed as an ISO 8601 date. A
        macro's version is the date of its last modification in the Archive.

2001-07-14:

        The Autoconf Archive repository has moved from cryp.to to
        <http://www.gnu.org/software/ac-archive/>. This change brings mostly
        public access to the CVS repository at Savannah. The move also
        allows the project to dub itself the "GNU Autoconf Archive".
