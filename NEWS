                     History of the Autoconf Macro Archive
                     =====================================

2007-07-29:

        This release is the first one to be distributed under the terms of the
        updated General Public License, version 3.

        The Autoconf Macro Archive provides a public GIT repository that can be
        cloned as follows:

          git clone http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to/.git

        A web front-end is also available:

          http://git.cryp.to/?p=autoconf-archive

        Having this web front-end is nice because it allows every macro to link
        directly into the repository for its own history.

2006-10-23:

        The Autoconf Macro Archive switched to new distribution format. Unlike
        the previous one, the new format has no visible markup and looks pretty
        much like formatted text. The m4 files now link to their home page.
        Also new is that the copyright licenses are spelled out.

2005-02-14:

        The Autoconf Macro Archive repository has moved from gnu.org to
        <http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to/>, mostly because running on my own
        infrastructure is far more convenient than depending on Savannah.

        This release is the first one to have an out-of-the-box installation
        procedure using Autoconf/Automake.

        The Free Software Foundation recommends the all-permissive license for
        Autoconf Macros. In an heroic effort, Tom Howard has contacted each and
        every macro author in an attempt to get their permission to re-license
        their work under the less restrictive license. More than 50 positive
        responses are received.

2005-01-21:

        Moved all macros into a flat hierarchy. Previous releases determined a
        macro's category by the name of the directory it was in. This
        convention no longer necessary. Having the files in a flat hierarchy
        works vastly better with the aclocal(1) utility than the previous
        layout.

        This release also marks the departure from free-style version numbers.
        All version information is expressed as an ISO 8601 date. A macro's
        version is the date of its last modification in the Archive.

2001-07-14:

        The Autoconf Macro Archive repository has moved from cryp.to to
        <http://www.gnu.org/software/ac-archive/>. This change brings mostly
        public access to the CVS repository at Savannah. The move also allows
        the project to dub itself the "GNU Autoconf Macro Archive".
