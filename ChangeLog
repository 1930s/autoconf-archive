	This file is no longer used because the change history is
	available on-line directly from the GIT repository that contains
	the master versions of these files. To see the change log, direct
	your favorite web browser to the following location:

	  http://git.cryp.to/?p=autoconf-archive;a=shortlog

	For every release tarball, there is an appropriate tag of the same
	name to identify the GIT version that particular release was built
	from.

	The same information is also available in other representations
	suitable for subscription:

	  ATOM Log:  http://git.cryp.to/?p=autoconf-archive;a=atom
	  RSS Feed:  http://git.cryp.to/?p=autoconf-archive;a=rss
