#+TITLE: Autoconf Archive TODO    -*- mode:org;coding:utf-8;fill-column:79; -*-

* TODO Document our new mailing lists.

  * http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/autoconf-archive-announce

    This is a low-traffic mailing list used to announce new releases of the
    Autoconf Archive.

  * http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/autoconf-archive-maintainers

    This mailing list can be used to contact the archive maintainers, i.e. to
    report problems with the website, the release tarballs, or the
    documentation. Patches (git-formatted or otherwise) can be posted here,
    too, although the patch tracker is the preferred way of submitting patches
    or new macros.

  * http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/autoconf-archive-commits

    This mailing list distributes an e-mail every time the 'master' branch has
    been changed in Git. Other branches, like 'maint', aren't tracked; there is
    only a moderate amount of traffic.


* TODO Decide how to handle non-ASCII content in m4 files

  Several macros contain non-ASCII characters, for example:

  : $ grep@ Ludo m4/*.m4
  : m4/_ac_c_ifdef.m4:#   Copyright (c) 2008 Ludovic CourtÃ¨s <ludo@chbouib.org>
  : m4/ac_cxx_compiler_vendor.m4:#   Copyright (c) 2008 Ludovic CourtÃ¨s <ludo@chbouib.org>
  : m4/ac_cxx_cppflags_std_lang.m4:#   Copyright (c) 2008 Ludovic CourtÃ¨s <ludo@chbouib.org>
  : m4/ac_cxx_cxxflags_std_lang.m4:#   Copyright (c) 2008 Ludovic CourtÃ¨s <ludo@chbouib.org>
  : m4/ac_cxx_ldflags_std_lang.m4:#   Copyright (c) 2008 Ludovic CourtÃ¨s <ludo@chbouib.org>
  : m4/ac_libtoolize_cflags.m4:#   Copyright (c) 2008 Ludovic CourtÃ¨s <ludo@chbouib.org>

  The encoding currently in use is "latin1", but the m4 files don't expose
  that information. The situation can be improved as follows:

  1) Add machine-readable charset declarations (i.e. for Emacs) to all m4
     files. (Or just to those that actually use non-ASCII?)

  2) Encode all files in UTF-8, like everyone else seems to do. (But add
     charset declarations anyway?)

  3) Restrict m4 files to ASCII.

  Pure ASCII is my favorite.

* TODO Figure out how to generate the AUTHORS file

  The file should contain the people who committed to Git and the people who
  are listed in m4 file copyright lines.

* TODO Improve submission guide lines on the web site

** New submissions should use an AX_ prefix.

   Other prefixes are fine, too, but use of AX_ inside of the Autoconf Archive
   is encouraged. The AC_ prefix should definitely be avoided, because it's
   reserved for the GNU Autoconf distribution.

** Patch submissions should put the original authors on Cc.

   Everyone is welcome to submit patches, bug reports, or suggestions to the
   Autoconf Archive. If you do, please add the original authors to carbon-copy
   list in the patch tracker. You don't have to, if you don't want to look
   their addresses up, but it's considered good practice to give the other
   authors a heads up when the macro is being changed.

** If possible, submit patches with Git.

   Give a usage example for git format-patch.

   If you have an account Savannah, simply request access to the Autoconf
   Archive's repository so that you can use git push.
