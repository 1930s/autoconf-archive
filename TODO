#+TITLE: Autoconf Archive TODO                 -*- mode:org;fill-column:79; -*-

* TODO Document our new mailing lists.

  * http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/autoconf-archive-announce

    This is a low-traffic mailing list used to announce new releases of the
    Autoconf Archive.

  * http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/autoconf-archive-maintainers

    This mailing list can be used to contact the archive maintainers, i.e. to
    report problems with the website, the release tarballs, or the
    documentation. Patches (git-formatted or otherwise) can be posted here,
    too, although the patch tracker is the preferred way of submitting patches
    or new macros.

  * http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/autoconf-archive-commits

    This mailing list distributes an e-mail every time the 'master' branch has
    been changed in Git. Other branches, like 'maint', aren't tracked; there is
    only a moderate amount of traffic.

* TODO Figure out how to generate the AUTHORS file

  The file should contain the people who committed to Git and the people who
  are listed in m4 file copyright lines.

* TODO Improve submission guide lines on the web site

* TODO VL_PROG_CC_WARNINGS and AX_CFLAGS_WARN* overlap.

  Contact the authors and ask whether they'd like to help re-factor the code.

** New submissions should use an AX_ prefix.

   Other prefixes are fine, too, but use of AX_ inside of the Autoconf Archive
   is encouraged. The AC_ prefix should definitely be avoided, because it's
   reserved for the GNU Autoconf distribution.

** Patch submissions should put the original authors on Cc.

   Everyone is welcome to submit patches, bug reports, or suggestions to the
   Autoconf Archive. If you do, please add the original authors to carbon-copy
   list in the patch tracker. You don't have to, if you don't want to look
   their addresses up, but it's considered good practice to give the other
   authors a heads up when the macro is being changed.

** If possible, submit patches with Git.

   Give a usage example for git format-patch.

   If you have an account Savannah, simply request access to the Autoconf
   Archive's repository so that you can use git push.

* TODO Recognize cross-links in macro documentation.

  Macros often refer to other entries in the archive. The macro2html and
  macro2texi scripts should recognize those references and generate appropriate
  links in the output.

* TODO Recognize URIs in macro documentation.

  Some macros feature http or mailto URIs. The generator scripts should
  recognize those and generate appropriate hyperlinks output (where feasible).

* TODO Figure out how to disable sc_file_system check in maint.mk

  Gnulib wants us to use spelling "file system" and objects when it sees the
  name ax_boost_filesystem in autoconf-archive.texi. There ought to be a way to
  avoid that error.
