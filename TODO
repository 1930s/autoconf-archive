* TODO Figure out a new link for the macro home pages.

  GNU suggests http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/macro-name.html as
  the URL of choice for all pages, but that link is really quite long, i.e. 13
  characters longer than, say http://autoconf-archive.gnu.org/macro-name.html,
  would be. Even http://www.nongnu.org/autoconf-archive/macro-name.html, the
  current choice, is 6 characters shorter than that.

* TODO Improve submission guide lines on the web site
** Patch submissions should put the original authors on Cc.

   Everyone is welcome to submit patches, bug reports, or suggestions to the
   Autoconf Archive. If you do, please add the original authors to carbon-copy
   list in the patch tracker. You don't have to, if you don't want to look
   their addresses up, but it's considered good practice to give the other
   authors a heads up when the macro is being changed.

** If possible, submit patches with Git.

   Give a usage example for git format-patch.

   If you have an account Savannah, simply request access to the Autoconf
   Archive's repository so that you can use git push.

* TODO Recognize cross-links in macro documentation.

  Macros often refer to other entries in the archive. The macro2texi scripts
  should recognize those references and generate appropriate links in the
  output.

  The implementation of this feature is not as simple as it may sound, because
  Texinfo doesn't offer plain and simple cross-references. There is @xref, of
  course, but use of that macros inserts additional words into the text! The
  reference =@xref{Node}=, for instance, is rendered as =*Note Node=. This
  property makes it very hard to insert references automatically.

* TODO Recognize URIs in macro documentation.

  Some macros feature http or mailto URIs. The generator scripts should
  recognize those and generate appropriate hyperlinks output (where feasible).

* TODO Re-enable disabled sc_* checks from maint.mk [0/6]

  Gnulib wants us to use spelling "file system" and objects when it sees the
  name ax_boost_filesystem in autoconf-archive.texi. There ought to be a way to
  avoid that error.

  Progress: The [[bootstrap.sh]] script disable those checks that don't work well
  for this project. In order to get on, though, some meaningful tests were
  disable, too. We should re-enable those and fix the macro contents to comply
  with those rules:

  * [ ] sc_m4_quote_check
  * [ ] sc_prohibit_strcmp
  * [ ] sc_space_tab
  * [ ] sc_useless_cpp_parens
  * [ ] sc_prohibit_magic_number_exit
  * [ ] sc_copyright_check

* TODO Generate serial lines automatically

  The script [[file:set-serial.sh][set-serial.sh]] uses the git repository to determine an appropriate
  serial number (i.e. the number of commits that have occurred) and patches
  that number into the m4 file. The solution seems to work nicely, but it isn't
  integrated into the build process yet.

* TODO Don't repeat license texts in Texinfo for every macro

  The Texinfo documentation has a section "license" for every macro that
  contains the complete license disclaimer. In case of the all-permissive
  license, that's no big deal because that license is very short. In case of
  GPL + Autoconf exception, however, this leads to a significant amount of
  redundancy in the generated documentation.

  It would be desirable to have the license texts in the documentation *once*
  and to have every macro refer to the appropriate section.
* DONE Add copyright notices to all files [3/3]

  * [X] autoconf-archive.texi should say what its own (the documentation)
        copyright is in the @copying. Presumably GFDLv1.3+.

  * [X] small top-level files like NEWS, ChangeLog, TODO should have some kind
        of notice, e.g., the all-permissive one.

  * [X] Makefile.am files should use the standard GPL notice, not just say
        "Licensed under the terms ...". That leaves it unclear as to what
        version of the GPL applies, and whether it is GPLvN-only vs.
        GPLvN-or-later.

* TODO Update infrastructure files from gnulib

  Most of our infrastructure files come from the Automake versions that's used
  to run =autoreconf -i=. However, there are newer files in gnulib that we
  should use instead: install-sh got a minor update, ditto the INSTALL file.
  texinfo.tex has also been updated.

  Karl Berry suggested using =gnulib/config/srclist-update= to keep those files
  synchronized.
* TODO Write a script that generates copyright lines from Git

  We have a bunch of administrative files, such as configure.ac or Makefile.am,
  and those files need some sort of copyright statement. The usual approach is
  to use "Copyright (c) 2010 Free Software Foundation, Inc.", like this file
  currently does, but that statement is not accurate, because the rights
  haven't been actually signed over to the FSF. Instead, it would be nice to
  generate proper copyright lines from the Git repository, using the authors
  and date stamps of the commits that modified the file. To some extend, that
  script could be used to maintain copyright lines in the macros, too, but
  unfortunately the macro history isn't all too reliable, because oftentimes
  the "author" of git commit is not necessarily the actual author, but merely
  the maintainer who's, well, committing it. For the administrative files,
  however, this shouldn't be a problem.
