Autoconf Archive
================

The Autoconf Archive is a collection of more than 450 macros for `GNU Autoconf
<http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf>`_ that have been contributed as free
software by friendly supporters of the cause from all over the Internet. Every
single one of those macros can be re-used without imposing any restrictions
whatsoever on the licensing of the generated `configure` script. In particular,
it is possible to use all those macros in `configure` scripts that are meant for
non-free software. This policy is unusual for a Free Software Foundation
project. The FSF firmly believes that software ought to be free, and software
licenses like the GPL are specifically designed to ensure that derivative work
based on free software must be free as well. In case of Autoconf, however, an
exception has been made, because Autoconf is at such a pivotal position in the
software development tool chain that the benefits from having this tool
available as widely as possible outweigh the disadvantage that some authors may
choose to use it, too, for proprietary software.

The best place to start exploring the Archive is the `on-line documentation
<http://www.nongnu.org/autoconf-archive/>`_. There is also the `Autoconf Archive
home page <http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/autoconf-archive/>`_ at Savannah.

Here are the GPG detached signatures:

* autoconf-archive-2010.02.14.tar.gz.sig_
* autoconf-archive-2010.02.14.tar.bz2.sig_
* autoconf-archive-2010.02.14.tar.xz.sig_

You can use either of the above signature files to verify that the
corresponding file (without the .sig suffix) is intact. First, be sure
to download both the .sig file and the corresponding tarball. Then, run
a command like this::

  gpg --verify autoconf-archive-2010.02.14.tar.gz.sig

If that command fails because you don't have the required public key,
then run this command to import it::

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 99089D72

and rerun the ``gpg --verify`` command.
