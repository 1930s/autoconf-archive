Synopsis
--------

 The `Autoconf Macro Archive <http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to/>`_
 aims to provide a collection of reusable Autoconf_ macros as
 free software. The archive currently features more than 500
 macros which perform portability tests ranging from compiler
 support for weird language extensions to automatic generation of
 sophisticated Automake_ rules. All these macros have been
 contributed by friendly supporters of the cause from all over
 the Internet; this archive is merely a distribution of other
 people's efforts.

How To Contribute
-----------------

 Have you written a macro and would like to share it? Great!
 Simply send the m4 source code to <simons@cryp.to> and include a
 brief description of the macro's functionality. Suggestions into
 which Archive category the macro belongs are appreciated. In any
 case, please state the following bits of information:

 * A synopsis showing how the macro is to be called.

 * The list of authors (optionally with e-mail addresses).

 * Licensing information.

 Any OSI_ compliant free software license is fine, but the best
 choice typically is the all-permissive license recommended_ for
 Autoconf macros by the Free Software Foundation. Other popular
 licenses used on this site are BSD, GPL, GPL with Autoconf
 exception, and LPGL.

 Formatting the macro submission in the Archive's markup is
 unnecessary, but it makes my life a little easier of you go
 through the trouble. You can use any of existing entries as a
 template to start from. When you submit a marked-up entry,
 however, please do not rely on special layout in your
 documentation except plain text and indented block quotes. One
 of the reasons for this limitation is that macro documentation
 will be subject to word-wrapping when presented as an HTML page.

 Another way to contribute to the Archive is to patch any of the
 existing macros. If you have fixed a bug or made any other
 enhancement, please send your complete edited version to the
 address above and Cc the e-mail to the *original authors* to
 give them a chance to comment on your changes. If you would like
 to submit a "diff" instead, please make sure to update the "last
 modified" date stamp appropriately so that the original version
 information is visible in the patch.
