The Autoconf Archive is a collection of more than 450 freely re-usable macros
for @uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf,GNU Autoconf} that have been
contributed by friendly supporters of the cause from all over the Internet.

The term ``free'' means two things in this context: (1) all macros distributed
by the Archive can be used free of charge and (2) their use imposes no
restrictions whatsoever on the licensing of the generated @file{configure}
script, i.e. it is possible to use those macros in @file{configure} scripts
that are meant for non-free software.

This official web site of this project is located at
@uref{http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/autoconf-archive/}. All available
information concerning this project is referenced from there.

If you have questions, suggestions, are any other feedback that you'd like to
share, then please don't hesitate to contact the Archive maintainers at
@email{autoconf-archive-maintainers@@nongnu.org}.
